-- 20261006_salary_generation_staging.sql  (staging schema)
--
-- Salary Generation tab (admin-only): upload the thumb-print machine's
-- attendance sheet, keep an employee list with salary + working hours,
-- calculate attendance / overtime / salary per month, and log every manual
-- edit of an in/out time.
--
-- ADMIN-ONLY at the database level (not just hidden in the UI): salaries are
-- confidential. Every table below has a single admin-only RLS policy.
--
-- Design notes
--  * salary_punches holds the RAW machine punches. They are never edited;
--    re-uploading a month replaces that month's punches only.
--  * Manual corrections live in salary_time_overrides (current state), and
--    EVERY change is also appended to salary_time_edits (audit log). The log
--    is append-only: no update/delete grant, no update/delete policy.
--  * Employees are matched by the machine "No" (stable), not by name.
--  * Overtime / salary are computed in the app (src/lib/salaryCalc.ts), not
--    stored, so they always follow the latest edits and settings.
--  * salary_payments records "Paid" with the amount at the time of payment,
--    so a later edit shows up as a difference instead of silently changing
--    history.
-- SAFE / additive. Run in the Supabase SQL editor (if a big paste times out, run it in
-- 3-4 chunks: tables, grants + RLS, policies, seed).
-- notify pgrst, 'reload schema';  -- run once after, so the API sees the new tables
